## Description
The reason I created this small app was to practice more with some front end design and was interested in making my own automated chat bot that most companies like Disney and Bank of america use for their customer service. 

## Commands 
Currently there are a few simple commands 
  - "hey"
  - "doing good" 
  - "what are you"
  - "you are so cool"

These are the messages you can currently send to the bot, I plan on making more commands in the future.
